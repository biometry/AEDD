# AEDD: African Elephant Demographic Database

African Elephant Demographic Database (AEDD) and metadata resulting from a systematic review of the scientific and ‘grey’ literature on African elephant demography.

This is the github repository for the database published by Hauenstein et al. (2022, see PDF in folder `resources`).
For details of which literature was used, see that publication.

This webpage provides the frozen version published alongside the paper (on figshare: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/A_systematic_map_of_demographic_data_from_elephant_populations_throughout_Africa_implications_for_poaching_and_population_analyses_-_supplementary_data/19387085). 

Additionally, we try to update the AEDD here whenever new demographic or population size information become (openly) available.
