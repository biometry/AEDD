# AEDD: African Elephant Demographic Database

This is the github repository for the database published by Hauenstein et al. (2022, see PDF in folder `resources`).
For details of which literature was used, see that publication.

This webpage provides the frozen version published alongside the paper (on figshare: http://). 

Additionally, we try to update the AEDD here whenever new demographic or population size information become (openly) available.

If you want to notify us of a paper, please send an email to: info@biom.uni-freiburg.de
